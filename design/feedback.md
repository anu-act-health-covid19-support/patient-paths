# Feedback

`patientpaths` needs feedback on the design, the implementation, the way it
integrates with other systems and the open-source modelling software ecosystem
in general, etc.

## People to ask

Here are a few people who we could ask for feedback:

- **Katie Glass**, both for her own feedback and also for connections to others
  (in ANU and beyond) who might give helpful feedback

- **Rob Moss** about how this might be integrated with other modelling work
  they're doing

- **Michael Phipps**, for feedback on what'd be useful from a CHS perspective
